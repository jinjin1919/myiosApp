## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

1. SnapChat:  feature: can take a picture with emoji and add artificial glasses and beard to the face

2. Instagram:  feature: user can post picture and shorts 


I would like to build an app like pinerest and etsy combined, could search content, post review and give ratings and have a marketplace that user could shopping and add favorites items in their shopping cart and checkout with payment methods. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I was not using storyboard at the beginning that post some challenge for writing the code.
